## Tindog: The Social Network for Dogs

Tindog is a responsive, landing page designed as a social platform where dog owners can download the application for their pets to interact and form a virtual community.

## Technical Showcase: 

This project served as my capstone to integrate the niche responsiveness front-end skill:

- **Front End:** Built with HTML5 and styled using modern, utility-first CSS.

- **Responsiveness:** Prioritized a mobile-first approach, ensuring pixel-perfect layout and optimal user experience across all device screen widths.
